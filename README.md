# EpidemicSpread
A repository containing all underlying matlab files relevant to my upcoming epidemic spread paper "Epidemic Arrival Times; Theory, Discussion, and Limitations", now avaliable on Arxiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05557

Here we provide the underling matlab files used to generate the vast majority of the figures. 
Unfortunately, the underlying data behind Fig 10 is proprietary, and was provided via personal correspondence, and thus can not be published here.
